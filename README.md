# Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning for RAG

A modular framework to fine-tune large language models using **Adapters** for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks, with a custom evaluation metric to measure semantic accuracy.

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This repository demonstrates:

- **Adapter Fine-Tuning**: Insert lightweight adapter modules into an existing pretrained LLM (e.g., T5 or GPT-style) for efficient task adaptation.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combine a dense retriever (FAISS) or ElasticSearch index with the fine-tuned generator to answer queries using external documents.
- **Custom Metric**: Extend traditional metrics (BLEU/ROUGE/F1) with semantic-aware weighting and correctness logic to better capture answer relevance.
